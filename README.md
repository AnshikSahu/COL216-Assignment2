#### Instructions: write the MIPS assembly code in a file and save it as input.asm. Then use the following make commands to simulate a pipeline.

1. all - to update all dependencies
2. compile - to compile and generate the executable for all the 4 simulator parts
3. run_5stage - to run the simulator for the 5-stage pipeline
4. run_5stage_bypass - to run the simulator for the 5-stage pipeline with forwarding and bypassing
5. run_79stage - to run the simulator for the 7 and 9-stage stage pipeline
6. run_79stage_bypass - to run the simulator for the 7 and 9-stage stage pipeline with forwarding and bypassing
